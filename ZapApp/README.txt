-This App was made as part of the challenge solution for the Java Development Intern Position.

-A user can input a Product ID or Product Name along with his/her email address and the app will send out an email to the given address 
anytime the item goes on a 20% or more discount.

-I used Java, HTML5, JSP, jQuery, Javascript along with JavaMail and JSON API(javax.json).

-Sample Inputs: 
ID - 7515478
OR
Name - tall

Either deploy the war file or place the ZapApp folder as is on the server.

-To Run, Go to

relative to the server's root address.
