<h1>Welcome to the ZapApps Homepage</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Following are two applications which I made as part of the Intern Application process for Zappos.com</p>
<ul>
<li><b><u><a target="_blank" href="ZapApp/web/wishlist.html">WishList App</a></u></b>
<br/>This App was made as part of the challenge solution for the Java Development Intern Position.
<br/>A user can input a Product ID or Product Name along with his/her email address and the app will send out an email to the given address 
anytime the item goes on a 20% or more discount.
<br/>I used Java, HTML5, JSP, jQuery, Javascript along with JavaMail and JSON API(javax.json).
<br/>Sample Inputs: <br/>ID - 7515478<br/>OR Name - tall
</li>
<li><b><u><a target="_blank" href="ZapApp2/Default.aspx">Gift Suggesting App</a></u></b>
<br/>This App was made as part of the challenge solution for the Software Engineering Intern Position.
<br/>A user has to enter a desired amount which he/she wants to spend and the number of gifts he/she wants to buy. The App 
will make suggestions on which combinations of products are best suited as per the given inputs.
<br/>I used ASP.NET, C#, HTML5 along with the JSON.Net package(by Newtonsoft).
<br/>Sample Inputs: <br/>No of Items - 4<br/>Desired Amount - 600
</li>
